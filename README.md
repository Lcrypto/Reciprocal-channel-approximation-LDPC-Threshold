# Reciprocal channel approximation RCA for Multi Edge Type LDPC
Protograph reciprocal-channel approximation (RCA) for approximation of Density Evolution Iterative Decoding Threshold under AWGN-channel of Multi-Edge Type (MET) LDPC Codes. Using RCA constructed codes from article S.-Y.Chung G.D. Forney, T.J. Richardson, R. Urbanke On the design of low-density parity-check codes within 0.0045 dB of the Shannon limit, IEEE Communications letters 5 (2), 58-60, 2001. RCA method in detail described at S.-Y.Chung,“On the construction of some capacity-approaching coding schemes,” Ph.D. dissertation, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2000.
