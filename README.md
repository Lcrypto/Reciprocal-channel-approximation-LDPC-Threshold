# Reciproent-channel-approximation-RCA-for-LDPC
Reciprocal-channel approximation (RCA) for approximation of Density Evolution Iterative Decoding Threshold protograph based MET-LDPC Codes using on which constructed codes from article S.-Y.Chung G.D. Forney, T.J. Richardson, R. Urbanke On the design of low-density parity-check codes within 0.0045 dB of the Shannon limit, IEEE Communications letters 5 (2), 58-60, 2001. 


RCA method in detail described at S.-Y.Chung,“On the construction of some capacity-approaching coding schemes,” Ph.D. dissertation, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2000.
