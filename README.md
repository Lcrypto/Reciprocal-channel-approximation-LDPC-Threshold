# Reciprocal channel approximation RCA for Multi Edge Type LDPC
Protograph reciprocal-channel approximation (RCA) for approximation of Density Evolution Iterative Decoding Threshold under AWGN-channel of Multi-Edge Type (MET) LDPC Codes. Using RCA constructed codes from article S.-Y.Chung G.D. Forney, T.J. Richardson, R. Urbanke On the design of low-density parity-check codes within 0.0045 dB of the Shannon limit, IEEE Communications letters 5 (2), 58-60, 2001. RCA method in detail described at S.-Y.Chung,“On the construction of some capacity-approaching coding schemes,” Ph.D. dissertation, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2000. Very good compare of quality of GA, GA-RCA and Pure DE at paper Sarah J. Johnson, et al "A New Density Evolution Approximation for LDPC and Multi-Edge Type LDPC Codes," in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 64, no. 10, pp. 4044-4056, Oct. 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04665.pdf. Work on old and new version of Matlab.
