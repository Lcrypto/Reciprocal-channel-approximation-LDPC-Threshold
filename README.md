# Reciprocal channel approximation RCA for Multi Edge Type LDPC
The GitHub repository contains a tool for Protograph Reciprocal-Channel Approximation (RCA) using Density Evolution Multi-Edge Type (MET) LDPC Codes Iterative Decoding Threshold under AWGN-channel. This tool applies the RCA method to construct codes based on the paper "On the design of low-density parity-check codes within 0.0045 dB of the Shannon limit" by S.-Y.Chung, G.D. Forney, T.J. Richardson, and R. Urbanke, published in IEEE Communications Letters in 2001.

The RCA method is described in detail in S.-Y. Chung's Ph.D. dissertation, "On the construction of some capacity-approaching coding schemes," from MIT in 2000. The tool includes a comparison of GA, GA-RCA, and Pure DE methods with very good accuracy, as done in the paper "A new density evolution approximation for LDPC and multi-edge type LDPC codes" by Sarah J. Johnson et al., published in IEEE Transactions on Communications in 2016.

The tool has been tested on both old (2011) and newer versions (2018) of MATLAB and GNU Octave 5.1 (which is slower than MATLAB).

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in Protograph RCA for MET-LDPC codes. The tool is based on well-regarded research papers and has been tested on multiple versions of MATLAB and GNU Octave.
